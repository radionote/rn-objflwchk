System rn-objflwchk (Object Flow Checkpoint) is in order to check flowing objects at several checkpoints.

Typical installation will be done by the following steps.

1. Place directory rn-objflwchk to a shared directory
2. Edit file rn-objflwchk/inventory/conf/checkpoints.definition to define checkpoints
3. Delete directories rn-objflwchk/inventory/checkpoints-records/* and create directories whose names are those of defined checkpoints
4. Execute rn-objflwchk/bin/checker.sh (on Unix) or rn-objflwchk/bin/checker.bat (on Win32) at each checkpoint
